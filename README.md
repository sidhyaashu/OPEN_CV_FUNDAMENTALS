# Open_CV_Fundamentals
Fundamentals about OpenCV with Python


OpenCV, which stands for "Open Source Computer Vision," is a popular open-source library used for computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides tools and functions to help computers understand and analyze images and videos, such as detecting objects, recognizing faces, tracking movements, or enhancing image quality. OpenCV is widely used in applications like facial recognition, self-driving cars, augmented reality, and more. It supports multiple programming languages, including Python, C++, and Java, making it accessible to developers and researchers for creating powerful vision-based applications.
